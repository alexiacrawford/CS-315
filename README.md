This course focuses on graph algorithms, algorithm design patterns, and complexity classes.
"Welcome! This course focuses on graph algorithms, algorithm design patterns, and complexity classes. The first part of the course is on graph representation, graph search, topological sort, minimum spanning trees, and the shortest paths. The second part covers recursion, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, and greedy algorithms, including Huffman coding and network flows. The third part talks about time complexity, reductions, and NP-completeness. The course involves designing, implementing, and analyzing algorithms."
